\chapter{Study}

This chapter gives an overview of the literature survey and investigation done for this project. We also discuss the reasoning behind some of the important design decisions.
%The major activity in this chapter is literature survey, investigation
%and arriving at the targetted scope and specifications. Here the 'what',
%'why' and 'how' of the product and product sub-parts are studied.
%One looks for similars in already existing products and makes comparisons.
%One identifies potential decisions that need to be taken with respect
%to the product evolution and performs a comparative statement of possible
%options that will affect design decisions. 

%NOTE: While discussing the various options and the comparisions, you
%need to cite appropriate references at appropriate places in the text.
%A typical \emph{citation} \cite{paper1,paper2,paper3,paper4,paper5,paper6} is
%referred as shown here. The cited references will automatically be
%reflected in the bibliography section in the order of occurence of
%citation in the manuscript. A sample \emph{report.bib} file is included
%in this template. Kindly go through it and make your bibliography
%file accordingly. A free software like \emph{JABREF} (a java application)
%or \emph{ZOTERO} (a firefox addon) can be used to create your bibliography
%file.

\section{Module study}
This section dwells in literature survey and design decision done for the individual modules.

\subsection{Protocols for communication}
We studied the protocols that can be used between the links present in the system. There are four different links in the system.
\begin{itemize}
\item link between the \emph{PanicButton device} and the back-end server,
\item link between the smartphone and the back-end server,
\item link between the smartphone and the \emph{PanicButton device},
\item link between the back-end server and the PCRs.
\end{itemize}
The following subsections will go into the details of each of them.
\subsubsection{Protocol for messaging between the \emph{PanicButton device}, the back-end server and PCRs}
The message link between panic button and back-end server must be a low latency link. In order to achieve that we looked at different protocols with their merits and demerits. The following protocols can be used for this link.
\begin{itemize}
\item Hypertext Transfer Protocol 1.1 (HTTP)
\item Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
\item Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
\end{itemize} 
HTTP is one of most widely used protocol for data transfer. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (WWW). HTTP is a text based application layer protocol, which uses Representation State Transfer (REST) with four methods \emph{GET}, \emph{PUT}, \emph{POST} and \emph{DELETE}.\\
MQTT is one of the emerging protocol in the Internet of Things(IoT) domain. MQTT uses Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) as transport layer. It uses publish subscribe pattern with only two methods \emph{SUBSCRIBE} and \emph{PUBLISH}. MQTT is a protocol with very small header overhead.\\
CoAP is another IoT protocol designed specifically to be used in the lightweight environments.  CoAP is designed to easily translate to HTTP for simplified intergration with the web. CoAP runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) transport layer.\\
Table~\ref{tab:mess_procotols} compares different protocols.
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c| } 
 \hline
 \textbf{Protocol} & \textbf{REST/PubSub} & \textbf{Transport layer protocol} &\textbf{header} & \textbf{Min-header (bytes)} \\
 \hline 
 \hline
 HTTP & REST & TCP & Text & 18 \\
 \hline
 MQTT & PubSub & TCP & Binary & 2 \\ 
 \hline
 CoAP & REST & UDP & Text & 4  \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Camparision of HTTP, MQTT and CoAP} \label{tab:mess_procotols}
\end{table}
The architecture of the our system can benefit from publish subscribe model for transparent transfer of messages between the \emph{PanicButton device} and PCR, where back-end server will act as a message broker. The back-end server can relay messages transparently to different PCRs at different locations. MQTT uses binary header with smallest packet size of just 2 bytes, which helps in reducing the bandwidth requirement for the communication. 
\subsubsection{Protocol for audio streaming}
The audio stream link between the \emph{PanicButton device} and back-end server requires high throughput, low latency, guaranteed delivery link. The protocols under consideration are
\begin{itemize}
\item HTTP1.1 over TCP
\item Raw over TCP
\item Raw over UDP
\end{itemize}
We decided to use raw over TCP because it fulfills the requirements for this link. HTTP 1.1 also provides the same benefits as raw over TCP, but adds large header overhead which is not desired. The extra information regarding the stream can be embedded in the compressed audio stream explained in the next section.
\subsection{Compression algorithm}
\label{sec:compression}
The use of wireless link from the \emph{PanicButton device} to the back-end server restricts the bandwidth which is available for audio transmission. The compression of audio stream is essential for reliable transfer of audio from panic button to back-end server under congestion.\\

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c| } 
 \hline
 \textbf{Format} & \textbf{Lossless} & \textbf{Compression factor} &\textbf{Open-source/royalty-free} \\
 \hline 
 \hline
 Raw & Yes &  1:1 & Yes\\
  \hline
 Wav & Yes &  1:1 & Yes\\
 \hline
 Mp3 & No &  5:1 & No\\
 \hline
 Vorbis Ogg & No &  10:1 & Yes\\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Expermental comparision of different audio formats at 44100 sample rate and 16-bit per sample} \label{tab:audio_formats}
\end{table}
Different audio formats are experimentally compared in table~\ref{tab:audio_formats}. Vorbis is open-source, royalty free audio compression and streaming format. Vorbis ogg's performance is better compared to mp3 in terms of compression ratio. We decided to use Vorbis Ogg audio format for streaming audio from the \emph{PanicButton device} to the back-end server.
\subsection{Encryption algorithm}
%\subsubsection{Encryption between panic button and back-end server}
Encryption is used to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks between the  \emph{PanicButton device} and the back-end server. Two of the most popular encryption algorithms are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and RSA algorithm. RSA algorithm uses asymmetric key configuration, while AES algorithm uses symmetric key configuration. The advantage of using RSA algorithm over AES is that, even if public key(key stored in panic button) is compromised, the communication is not compromised.
We decided to use RSA over AES due to this advantage.
%\subsubsection{Encryption between enclosure tamper detection module and core-module}

%\subsection{System validation module}
%One of the most essential part of the system is to have a self check mechanism to ensure the full functioning of the system. In case an anomaly is found in the system, it should notify the user as well as the back-end server.\\
%The panic button is installed in the public transport which makes it very vulnerable to tampering. There are number of ways in which it can be tampered. Few of them are
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Removing the power source from the panic button.
%\item Tampering with the physical button.
%\item Tampering with the microphone.
%\item Tampering with the enclosure.
%\item Physically change in the circuit.
%\item Change in firmware of the micro-controllers.
%\item Replacing the entire system with a dummy one.
%\item Swapping two system with each other.
%\end{itemize}
%The system must be able to detect any kind of tampering, in order %to keep the trust intact with the users.\\
%We propose few tamper detection mechanisms, which can warn the %user while boarding.
%\subsubsection{Enclosure tamper detection}
%In order to detect tampering with the system, unauthorized access to internal circuitry and components must be detected. To handle this undesirable event we looked at following methods.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item An ultra low power push button based detection system, %which will change the state of button if somebody tries to open %the enclosure.
%\item An ultra low power wire based detection system, which will %break if somebody tries to open the enclosure.
%\end{itemize}
%In push button based detection system, push button will be %installed inside the enclosure, which will be enabled as soon as %enclosure opens.\\
%In wire based detection system, wire runs around the periphery of %the enclosure, which will permanently break as soon as enclosure %opens.\\
%Tamper detection module must be always-on, independent of the %power source availability. It must have battery life of atleast %few years for tamper detection to work reliably.\\
%The tamper detection module must retain state independent of %change the firmware or change of the component. In order to %achieve that the core-module must detect that change. We propose %to store secret private key in tamper detection module and core-%module. The communication between the core-module is encrypted so %that third party can't watch the exchange of messages. In case of %tamper, tamper detection module permanently deletes his copy of %private key.\\
%Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm is not appropriate %for ultra low power microcontroller. A tiny footprint encryption %algorithm is required to encrypt the messages transfered between %core-module and tamper detection module.\\
%Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) is a encryption algorithm %suitable for ultra low power microcontroller. Instead to relying %on complicated operation, it uses large number of iterations of %simple operations\cite{tea_paper}. We used Modified Tiny %Encryption Algorithm (MTEA), which is based on TEA with 16-bit %operations instead of 32-bit operations.
  



\input{audioStudy}

%For each of the modules, include
%\begin{itemize}
%\item an exhaustive list of stimuli to the module
%\item classification of the stimuli as input/output, power signal/information
%signal, electric/mechanical etc.
%\item First level quantification of the stimuli like, voltage levels, type
%of signals (dc, ac, pulsed), rise time, current levels, etc.
%\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Sub-modules}

%If necessary, partition the various modules into sub-modules and %so
%on till the component level. 

%\emph{NOTE}: At every module, sub-module or component level (electric
%hardware or algorithms or industrial design), if there are multiple
%options available, then perform a comparative study of the most significant
%features among the options to evaluate the merits and demerits of
%the various options. Based on the merits and demerits of the various
%options, give your recommendations for design.


\section{Industrial design}
Being a product for public safety service, it should blend with the vehicular environment yet remain accessible. The panic button mounted on the \emph{PanicButton device} has to be easily accessible 24x7. A button with area equal to the average area of adult hand and back-light will fulfill these requirements. Front panel of the \emph{PanicButton device} mounts three essential part namely panic button with status back-light, speaker and microphone. Front panel also acts as lid for the \emph{PanicButton device}. Secondary battery and electronics used in this project resides at the base of enclosure. Figure~\ref{fig:baselayout} shows a pictorial representation of the assembly.
