The \emph{PanicButton device} has to perform tasks like take user's input from the panic button, acquire audio data needed for audio-based trigger, communicate with the back-end server and user's smartphone, detect any tampering and run audio processing algorithms. Figure~\ref{fig:functionalDesc} and  figure~\ref{fig:functionalDescbus} shows the top level functional diagram of the \emph{PanicButton device} when installed in cabs/autos and bus respectively.

\emph{PanicButton device} is equipped with a panic button to take user inputs, bluetooth low energy (BLE) for communicating with the user's smartphone, global system for mobile communication (GSM) to communicate with back-end server, global positioning system (GPS) to locate the vehicle in case of emergency, microphone to record audio and speaker to play audio.

Users can validate \emph{PanicButton device} using their smartphone through a dedicated android application. Communication between the user's smartphone and the \emph{PanicButton device} is handled by the respective BLE module. After performing validation, user is notified with the status of microphone, emergency button, firmware and enclosure of the system.

Emergency is asserted, if either the panic button is pressed or scream is detected by audio-based trigger. In case of emergency, compressed stream of audio along with vehicle's location is sent to the server, for later examination.
