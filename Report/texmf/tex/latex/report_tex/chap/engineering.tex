\chapter{Engineering and fabrication} 

%This chapter includes all the engineering and fabrication details
%needed to develop the product. 

\section{Product structure}
The product looks like a simple box from outside but it's more than that. Beneath the button is a speaker and beside it lies a microphone. Top panel is a 3D printed panel, housing emergency button, speaker and microphone. Bottom side of top panel takes care of connection between the custom build button assembly and a push button switch, provides support for speaker housing and a projection to press push button of tamper detection module. The base hosts most of the electronics. Half of the base part is occupied by raspberry pi and its add-on board, other half is occupied by the battery and its charging circuitry. Side wall of base part exposes power connector to charge the secondary battery and power the entire electronics. Figure~\ref{fig:block_dia} shows the block diagram of the complete design.\\
In this chapter, we look at hardware tools, software tools and assembly/fabrication procedures required to make \emph{PanicButton device}.

%This section provides the overall structure of the product in a top-down
%manner as viewed by a person when opening up the product completely
%to its component parts. The overall structure is given with the help
%of a block diagram schematic. On some modules, embedded software may
%reside and its structure diagram can be shown separately module-wise.
%The structure diagram for any standalone software should also be included.


\section{Hardware modules}
The \emph{PanicButton device} can be divided into three parts namely raspberry pi, add-on board for raspberry pi and the enclosure. Base part of the enclosure acts the hosing for these modules.

\subsection{Raspberry pi}
Raspberry pi's sd card with modified Raspbian image, must be installed into the raspberry. Raspberry pi should be mounted on the base using four M2 screws of 0.5 cm length.

\subsection{Add-on board for raspberry pi}
Add-on board contains the BLE module, programming header for BLE module, GPS module, speaker module, emergency button headers and tamper detection module. Figure~\ref{fig:schematic} shows the circuit schematic for the raspberry pi's add-on board.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{schematic}
\caption{Schematic of raspberry Pi add-on board}
\label{fig:schematic}
\end{figure}
The add-on board has a non rectangular shape because of the ethernet and USB connectors of the raspberry pi. Mounting holes of the add-on board are aligned to the mounting holes of the raspberry pi board. Figure.~\ref{fig:enc_top_view} shows the top layer of add-on board's PCB and figure.~\ref{fig:enc_bottom_view} shows the bottom layer of the add-on board's PCB. Our application did not impose any constrain on the thickness of the substrate, hence common substrate of 1.6 mm thickness was used. All signal tracks on the PCB are of 10 mil width. The add-on board connects to raspberry pi via 26 pin female header and can be secured using M3 mounting screws.

\subsection{Enclosure of \emph{PanicButton device}}
Enclosure was fabricated using a 3D printer that uses fused deposition modeling technique. Many parts of top panel were fabricated individually. Figure ~\ref{fig:enc_views} shows different views of the fabricated panic button enclosure.
